# evac
Imagine with me the aftercourse of a natural calamity, after it hits -rescue teams are called. Now, the teams have no information about the number of people inside the premises, their location. This arrangement poses a lot of problems as the efforts of the rescue operations are going to be unconcentrated leading to higher response time to victims.  
</br>

EVAC is a full-stack soltuion to reduce reaction time drastically in the face of calamity. EVAC brings together multiple technologies to provide a solution that makes people's lives safer in the face of disaster.
